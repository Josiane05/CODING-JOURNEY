        <p>
            My name is <strong>Josiane Mushimiyimana</strong>.
            I'm a second-year student at <em>Adventist University Of Central Africa</em>, currently studying <strong>Software Engineering.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always been interested in <strong>health care and mostly in Pharmacy field</strong>, 
            but since I wasn't offered admission in that department I decided to study <strong>Software Engineering.</strong>    
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I believe that this is <strong>the best path for me</strong>, because technology can also play an important role in improving health care and making a difference in people's lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to become a skilled software developer who uses technology to solve real-world problems and create tools that help others.

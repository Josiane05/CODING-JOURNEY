    <p>
        My name is <strong>Josiane Mushimiyimana</strong>
        I'm second year student at <em>Adventist University Of Central Africa</em>, Currently studying <strong>Software Engineering.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        I have always been interested in <strong> health care and mostly in Pharmacy field</strong>, but since I wasn't offered admission in that department i decided to study <strong>Software Engineering.</strong>    
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I believe that this is <strong>the best path for me</strong>, because technology can also play an important role in improving health care and making difference in people's life.
    </p>
    <p>
        My Goal is to become a skilled software developer who uses technology to solve real-world problems and to create tools that help others.
